                        <h5>Defining Dark Patterns</h5>
                        <p>So what actually is a Dark Pattern? The term Dark Patterns was first coined by UX designer Harry Brignull as:</p>
                        <blockquote><i>“A user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills<sup>1</sup>”</i></blockquote>
                        <p>There are many different types of Dark Patterns, all with different methods of deceiving a user. Here are a few<sup>5</sup>:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Roach Motel: a service that is easy to sign up for but difficult to cancel</li>
                            <li>Hidden Costs: costs that are not displayed until the purchase is about to be completed (service fees, convenience fees, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Nagging: when a site interrupts you with popups or ads to distract</li>
                            <li>Basket Sneaking: adding items a user did not select themselves. This could be “bundled items” or samples</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A key detail is that Dark Patterns are <b>intentional</b>. Bad design is not the same as Dark Patterns since bad designs are not purposely misleading users. </p>

                        <h5>Why do businesses use these Dark Patterns?</h5>
                        <p>The main reason that businesses use Dark Patterns is to create growth, whether that is new users, revenue, or other metrics. Many large companies such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Amazon use these strategies in their products<sup>3</sup>.</p>
                        <p>These Dark Patterns are effective. They get users to sign up, spend more, or continue their subscription. It makes sense that companies would use these simple tricks to generate more revenue or present increased growth to investors.</p>
                        <p>These Dark Patterns are obviously very deceptive, and a lot of time designers and engineers know that. They often do not want to implement these practices, but lofty business goals often leave teams with very few choices in meeting standards<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                        <h5>The Case against Dark Patterns</h5>
                        <p>With Dark Patterns you are actively choosing to deceive users. This will anger users and drive them to resent your company.</p>
                        <blockquote><i>“If you manipulate your customers, eventually, they won’t be your customers anymore<sup>2</sup>.”</i> - Harry Brignull</blockquote>
                        <p>People are starting to catch on to these deceptive practices. They are being used more than ever and more people are realizing they are being taken advantage of. In addition to damaging brands and reputations, it leads to a lot of public complaints and outrage, sometimes capturing the attention of lawmakers. While law has been slow in catching up with technology, the European Union (EU) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have imposed large fines on unlawful Dark Patterns used by companies such as Google<sup>4</sup>. Using these Dark Patterns may have a negative effect long term if found unlawful, often undoing any progress gained with the deceptive methods.</p>
                        <p>Another drawback of Dark Patterns are that they backfire long term. The short term growth from deceptive practices are unsustainable and can only trick users for so long.</p>
                        <blockquote><i>“Any short-term gains a company gets from a dark pattern is lost in the long term<sup>2</sup>.”</i> - Hoa Loranger, vice president of UX consulting firm Nielsen Norman Group</blockquote>
                        <p>Companies are damaging their reputation and angering users which leads to low retention rates in the long term. So when a team decides to use Dark Patterns to meet metric goals, is it actually good for the company?</p>

                        <h5>Moving away from Dark Patterns</h5>
                        <p>So how can designers and developers fight the inclusion of Dark Patterns in their products? Advocate against them. We have a responsibility for the products we work on and how they affect our users. We need to build a case against the Dark Patterns that higher ups may ask us to implement. </p>
                        <p>Often the business goals are what drive us to use Dark Patterns. Metrics such as new users, revenue, and clicks are seen as North Star metrics that measure the health of a product. While important, they are not a pure indication. Especially long term. Metrics such as retention, user satisfaction, and task completion rates are important in gauging your products long term health. Advocating for these metrics to be used in measuring success will help your team make decisions that benefit the product in the long term. </p>
                        <p>Dark Patterns are an easy way of artificially boosting metrics, but we can improve user experiences and conversion rates without deception. Understanding what drives us to use Dark Patterns can help us prevent them in the future. Advocating for long term metrics when setting business goals, or communicating how users will respond to deception long term can help persuade others to stay away from these practices. </p>
