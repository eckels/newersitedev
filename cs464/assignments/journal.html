                        <h5>Entry 1</h5>
                        <p>Today I was at the gym with my roommates, and I realized that they both had their headphones in while we worked out, despite us all doing the same workout together. It was hard to talk to them. I had to repeat things to them because they would only notice me talking after a few seconds and then had to take out an earbud or pause their music. I had to repeat myself a lot and found it frustrating. It was hard to communicate. I eventually decided to get my own earbuds and listen to music while we did our workout. It was pretty nice being able to hear my music while working out, but it made it really hard to communicate with us all having headphones. Short interactions that should take 5 seconds would take 20-30 seconds sometimes just because nobody could hear.</p>
                        <p>This made me really think about the book Reclaiming Conversation that we read in class. Our attention is split, if not more focused on the music. We are all distracted and treat each other as secondary. It isn’t like we didn’t want to talk to each other, but we just felt like the music was more important than talking to each other. We could put it on pause to talk, but there was often a rush to put the headphone back in. We were still talking, but we were just talking less. By keeping our headphones in we were coming off as less approachable.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 2</h5>
                        <p>Today I had a meeting for a capstone group project. We held the meeting online, which was nice because I did not have to travel. We had the meeting, it went pretty well and we got a lot of good information, but there was a lot of information to process. Our professor asked if there were any questions before the meeting ended, and we all said no and ended the call. I felt we needed to talk amongst each other as a group of students to sort of process and set up next steps but we all got off the call and were silent in our group chat. Everyone went right back to what they were doing before the call.</p>
                        <p>With the digital meetings it feels like we don’t have the chance to quickly ask someone else a quick question or say something like “can we talk about that for a few minutes?” as a follow up to the meeting because we cannot really turn to anyone very easily. We could send a message, but there isn’t really any guarantee that they will respond. The moment you log off you can’t see anyones faces or see if they are present or ready for a question. How do you choose who you ask your question to? Who is busy? I think there is some benefit to being in person for things like meetings because it can help you wrap things up and see people, but instead it ends so abruptly and who knows what everyone is thinking after they log off.</p>
