                        <h5>Entry 1</h5>
                        <p>Today I was at the gym with my roommates, and I realized that they both had their headphones in while we worked out, despite us all doing the same workout together. It was hard to talk to them. I had to repeat things to them because they would only notice me talking after a few seconds and then had to take out an earbud or pause their music. I had to repeat myself a lot and found it frustrating. It was hard to communicate. I eventually decided to get my own earbuds and listen to music while we did our workout. It was pretty nice being able to hear my music while working out, but it made it really hard to communicate with us all having headphones. Short interactions that should take 5 seconds would take 20-30 seconds sometimes just because nobody could hear.</p>
                        <p>This made me really think about the book Reclaiming Conversation that we read in class. Our attention is split, if not more focused on the music. We are all distracted and treat each other as secondary. It isn’t like we didn’t want to talk to each other, but we just felt like the music was more important than talking to each other. We could put it on pause to talk, but there was often a rush to put the headphone back in. We were still talking, but we were just talking less. By keeping our headphones in we were coming off as less approachable.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 2</h5>
                        <p>I got lunch with a friend today, someone I haven’t seen in a while and someone I generally don’t talk to online. The reason I am writing about this is because we managed to stay off our phones almost the entire time we were eating and waiting for our food. It was pretty different from what I am used to, a full hour and a half of uninterrupted conversation. The conversation felt like it flowed pretty well and had few breaks. It felt like we were getting to some non-surface level topics. It went pretty well up until the end when we both started to check our phones.</p>
                        <p>Once the conversation hit a dead spot I would get the urge to check my phone. Each time it happened I would feel a greater urge to check, most likely out of FOMO from not checking for a long time. The conversation would get more splintered and eventually we would check our phones. We were both using our phones to get out of awkward pauses. It almost felt like an easy way out instead of trying to brainstorm a new topic. It kind of is like how in Reclaiming Conversation the author discusses that we just aren’t practicing conversation, and in this case, we aren’t challenging ourselves to create conversation in difficult situations and we fall on technology to escape trying to solve the problem.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 3</h5>
                        <p>I sometimes try to avoid my phone as much as I can on the weekend, mostly because I have so many school or work related notifications that pop up that I know can wait for another time. It feels really nice because I don’t get stressed out from any of the notifications and do not feel any pressure to respond. It makes me feel less anxious throughout the day generally, but it does have its issues.</p>
                        <p>Whenever I pick up my phone and see multiple notifications it kind of freaks me out and I have to remind myself that I promised to stay away from them for the day. On top of that, as the day goes on, I just wonder if I am missing anything urgent and that makes me anxious. At the same time I can’t turn the notifications off because I don’t want to miss anything. I’ve found these notifications can really mess with my head even if I try to avoid them. I only lasted until around 5:00pm before I went through the notifications. I was initially relieved, only to kind of stress out later from the notifications buzzing around in my head.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 4</h5>
                        <p>Today I had two intramural soccer games, which I was pretty excited about. Generally throughout the day I spend my free time on my phone, but for whatever reason today I was staying off my phone and thinking about the game. Who we were playing, who was going to the game, what formation we would use, etc. A lot of thoughts revolving around the games. I found myself turning to my phone less during these few hours even when I wasn’t playing. I found myself sitting around and thinking about playing instead of scrolling through Twitter or Instagram. It felt peaceful and I felt fulfilled. It made me think about Reclaiming Conversation where the author talks about the first chair, solitude, where we are comfortable with our own thoughts. I felt like I had something more exciting to think about to myself than whatever my phone could give me. It was relaxing and upon reflection made me feel better about myself.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 5</h5>
                        <p>Today I had a meeting for a group project. We held the meeting online, which was nice because I did not have to travel. We had the meeting, it went pretty well and we got a lot of good information, but there was a lot of information to process. Our professor asked if there were any questions before the meeting ended, and we all said no and ended the call. I felt we needed to talk amongst each other as a group of students to sort of process and set up next steps but we all got off the call and were silent in our group chat. Everyone went right back to what they were doing before the call.</p>
                        <p>With the digital meetings it feels like we don’t have the chance to quickly ask someone else a quick question or say something like “can we talk about that for a few minutes?” as a follow up to the meeting because we cannot really turn to anyone very easily. We could send a message, but there isn’t really any guarantee that they will respond. The moment you log off you can’t see anyones faces or see if they are present or ready for a question. How do you choose who you ask your question to? Who is busy? I think there is some benefit to being in person for things like meetings because it can help you wrap things up and see people, but instead it ends so abruptly and who knows what everyone is thinking after they log off.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 6</h5>
                        <p>I have a friend that is pretty hard to reach on his phone at almost all times. You can text him or call him, but you almost always get ghosted because his phone is always on mute. On top of that, if he calls and you miss the call, he will never send a text with the subject of the call, and texting him to ask him only results in getting ghosted again. It’s pretty frustrating because he is almost always using his computer and online in some capacity. He has his phone with him, but chooses to completely ignore messages. The reason I am writing about this is because I sort of realize that since he has a phone, I expect him to be able to respond. Or to use it in some capacity. But if he didn’t have his phone, I wouldn’t get frustrated or expect him to respond. I would be more understanding of it. But we live in a society where everyone has a phone and uses it to communicate, and now I have this expectation that people should be reachable digitally, but instead I am frustrated. It is interesting how the norms of society influence how I see my friends and how I build my expectations around technology.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 7</h5>
                        <p>I feel that because of technology I do not go outside enough. I can get food delivered, call friends digitally, be easily entertained by streaming services, it all makes it so easy to just stay inside. Today I felt like distancing myself from that. Also because I feel like my vision is getting worse and I know screens really make my eyes worse. So today I decided to grab a chair and just sit on my balcony for a while eating chips and just not using my phone at all. I turned my speaker on and put it on shuffle and left my phone on the ground. It was freezing cold, but I felt really relaxed just having basically no thoughts in my mind. It was the weekend and there wasn’t any pressure to do anything at all. I realized that my phone makes me pretty anxious even when I am using it for social media or something that is just scrolling. Real relaxation is just staring into space. No screen to look at, no show to watch. It felt good and I felt a little more ready for my day after that. Ready to take on the things that would make me feel really anxious. The author in Reclaiming Conversation talked about solitude and being comfortable just being in our own thoughts, and I initially thought of that as I would be actively thinking about my day or something specific that would make my life productive and time worth spending, but instead I was just people watching and having the most unproductive and fleeting thoughts that basically meant nothing and did not go anywhere. It felt nice. Maybe the author also includes useless thoughts in her definition of solitude.</p>

                        <h5>Entry 8</h5>
                        <p>Today I went to the Illinois vs Northwestern game with my friend. The game was really exciting, but there were a ton of stoppages for team and media timeouts. I often found myself scrolling through my phone during these breaks, despite there being other entertainment such as the dance team, cheer team, t-shirt throwing, talking to my friend, etc. I don’t know why I defaulted to my phone. All the social media apps would still be there after I left the game. Whereas some of the things happening in the stadium or having my friend right next to me were limited to my time at the game. I think next time I attend a game, I am going to do my best to stay off my phone and try to take in the entertainment in around me. Even if I feel like my phone would be more entertaining, I should give my surroundings more of a chance because they are more limited. I can check my phone at home, and I will not be able to go to Illinois games (as a student) after this semester. I should really take in the experience more, because I will probably regret it in the future.</p>
