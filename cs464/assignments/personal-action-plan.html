                        <h5>Identifying issues</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stay up to date with technology, especially newer industries with less regulation. I will also do my best to stay up to date with any new legislation, loopholes, and consider different perspectives on different topics that may not align with my own opinions.</li>
                            <li>Discuss topics with coworkers to inform myself or learn about a different opinion. This will help deepen my knowledge and help build awareness of how others perceive different issues/topics.</li>
                            <li>Cross check sources and information in articles about different topics to ensure I am getting facts and unbiased information.</li>
                            <li>Spend about 10-15 minutes a day in the morning reading technology news (Flipboard, TechCrunch, Wired, Social media, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>In my personal life</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep a list of companies that have ethical issues and try to avoid using services or products from them. On the flip side, keep a list of companies with good track records and consider that when choosing between alternatives.</li>
                            <li>Talk to friends and family who may be less informed about technologies/companies that are unethical and may lead to a cyber dystopia.</li>
                            <li>Try to avoid becoming reliant on technology. Do as much as I can offline without too much of an impact on my productivity.</li>
                            <li>Take control of my personal data. Take the time to go into settings and limit the amount of information that services can access, track, and sell.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>In the workplace</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Put myself in the shoes of the consumers. Ask myself if I would be comfortable using the product I am building, and also if my product is taking advantage of the average consumer. Take the extra time to consider this instead of blindly following orders.</li>
                            <li>Speak up if I feel something is unethical. Even if it is a manager. It is better to raise the issue and at least get people talking than to not raise the issue at all and push something unethical out to consumers.</li>
                            <li>Build loyalty to values rather than a company. By building my morals around certain values I do not become biased to a company and am more likely to notice unethical decisions and also take action against them.</li>
                            <li>Pursue employment elsewhere if I feel that I am supporting an unethical company despite my best efforts to make change. If all my efforts lead to little change, just leave so that I can make a positive impact somewhere else.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>In society and policy</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whenever I find out about an ethical issue in the news, try to see if there are any causes fighting against it. Then spread word against the company/industry through social media, word of mouth, and also by signing petitions or showing concern to local representatives.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the information spread on social media about ethical issues is true. If it isnâ€™t do my best to reply and spread awareness that a specific source is biased or incorrect.</li>
                            <li>Consider other audiences outside of myself when thinking about ethical issues. Just because something may benefit or not affect me does not mean that something is ethical.</li>
                        </ul>
