                        <p class="category">Assignment 1</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="body-content">
                        <p>8:00 in the morning. My alarm clock blares and then the automated voice reads out, &ldquo;morning standup in one hour.&rdquo; Yes, I know. Thank you for the useless reminder, Siri.</p>

                        <p>I start to get out of bed when I realize that my entire body aches. I can barely get out of bed. My stomach is upset from the tuna poke bowl I had last night. I look at my smart watch and it is blaring red with notifications saying my immune system is overactive and 30 notifications with warnings that I could have some serious illnesses.</p>
                        
                        <p>I spend a few minutes dismissing these notifications. Each one can only be cleared individually by hitting the X in the corner and then hitting &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo; on a prompt saying that I read the notification.</p>
                        
                        <p>8:05am, my alarm starts blaring again, and Siri&rsquo;s screeching voice reads out, &ldquo;morning standup in 55 minutes.&rdquo; I let out an angry sigh and get out of bed despite my aches and churning stomach. The alarm doesn&rsquo;t shut off until I get out of bed. The company I work for, Meat, gave out complimentary beds that sync up with our work schedules and personal calendars to cut down on missed meetings and help us start our mornings productively in our personal lives. I absolutely hate the thing but hey, free bed.</p>
                        
                        <p>It takes a full ten minutes for me to finally get past the work notifications and into my personal inbox on my smart watch. I see automated messages from my doctor&rsquo;s office saying that I have a scheduled virtual doctor&rsquo;s appointment for 1pm. My health insurance automatically schedules appointments when my health readings from my watch drops below a certain threshold. Great, another thing to cancel. I click through the UI to cancel the appointment through squinted eyes. The screen is so damn bright.</p>
                        
                        <p> I finally open my messages with my friend, Johnny. I type out, &ldquo;Hey Johnny, I am not going to be able to make our virtual lunch today. I am feeling pretty sick.&rdquo; Send. I put down my phone and lay on my floor to just take a second to breathe. My alarm can&rsquo;t sense I&rsquo;m laying down here.</p>
                        
                        <p>I start to close my eyes when I hear a ding. Johnny probably texted back. Probably just saying that it is fine and to feel better. I close my eyes again. I am rudely woken up by my virtual assistant reading out &ldquo;you have one high priority message from Johnny, would you like to hear it now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Fine&rdquo; I yell out. &ldquo;Message from Johnny: sounds good, Johnny&rdquo; reads Siri. Why does he always call everyone else Johnny? My name is Michael. Weird guy.</p>
                        
                        <p>I struggle to stand up, my stomach is just absolutely demolished. There is no way that I can go to work today. I am calling in sick. My company, Meat, the largest marketplace for edible animal tissue NFTs, makes us check in every morning with a smart health device to determine if we are ill enough to use a sick day or if it should be deemed a vacation day. I should&rsquo;ve known there was a catch when my offer said unlimited sick days.</p>
                        
                        <p>I walk over to the company provided device and it reads my temperature. &ldquo;99.2 degrees&rdquo; the virtual assistant reads out. &ldquo;Would you like us to send you some complimentary ibuprofen?&rdquo; Nice try. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I respond. I swear it is a trick they use to lower your temperature, so you no longer qualify for a sick day. The screen reads &ldquo;processing your request&#8230;&rdquo; I stand there waiting as this machine decides for me if I am sick enough to miss work.</p>
                        
                        <p>I get an abrupt popup on the device reading, &ldquo;morning standup in 30 minutes, click to dismiss.&rdquo; Come on, really? Dismiss. Then the medical device finishes processing. &ldquo;More data required.&rdquo; it reads out. &ldquo;Blood sample required for diagnosis.&rdquo; I hang my head in frustration. Really? I put my finger in the device and it pricks my finger and automatically applies a band-aid. The screen goes back to processing. Then it reads out &ldquo;You have been approved for a sick day, feel better!&rdquo; I let out a sigh of relief. Finally. Now I can go to bed.</p>
                        
                        <p>I walk over to my bed before I am rudely interrupted by the medical device. &ldquo;How was your experience today with the SickDay Pro?&rdquo; I groan and walk over to the SickDay Pro. I just take one look and it, and I am just already so irritated I just angrily unplug it. I mockingly use both hands to &ldquo;flip the bird&rdquo; at the unplugged device as I walk back to my bed. Finally, time to sleep.</p>
                        
                        <p>9:05am, my watch starts blaring. Groggily, I wake up squint at my watch. &ldquo;Your 3:30 &lsquo;team sync up&rsquo; has been moved to 4:00. Do you acknowledge this time change?&rdquo; Cool, I don&rsquo;t care. I hit acknowledge and close my eyes. My watch rings again. &ldquo;Could not verify identity. Use 2 factor authentication to acknowledge.&rdquo;</p>
                        
                        <p>I can barely move. My whole body is in pain. I don&rsquo;t want to deal with this right now. I throw my watch across the room and cover both ears with my pillow. My bed starts buzzing. &ldquo;Please reauthenticate your Meat corporate account to continue getting notifications with your Calendar Sleep number bed,&rdquo; it screeches at max volume. I try to ignore it, but it just keeps buzzing. Then my phone in my bedroom starts buzzing and reads out the same message. &ldquo;I do not want to authenticate right now!&rdquo; I yell. I don&rsquo;t even think I could open my eyes enough for the scanner to authenticate me with my retina.</p>
                        
                        <p>Eventually there are 5 different devices all sending out notifications to authenticate myself so I can access my work account. I am just curled up in fetal position with every blanket and pillow over me, trying to drown out the noise. Why is like half my house linked to my work account? I hate work from home. Home doesn&rsquo;t even feel like home. It feels like work. I can&rsquo;t even look in my mirror in the morning without seeing my work schedule glowing in the backlit display of the mirror.</p>
                        
                        <p>My ears are ringing. I can&rsquo;t take it. Screw this. Screw all this corporate BS. I am not even going to work, why do I still get these notifications?</p>
                        
                        <p>I muster up all my energy, walk downstairs to the circuit breaker and just shut off the power. The room finally turns quiet. No internet connection. Now I can rest. I return to my bed with a smile on my face, knowing that I will not be interrupted anymore. I look at the clock, 9:30am. I really spent that long just calling in sick? Wild.</p>
                        
                        <p>10:30am, I hear a buzzing outside. A drone? I didn&rsquo;t order delivery. I open my window and see a Meat corporate drone heading to my apartment window. The drone loudly reads out, &ldquo;Internet and power outage detected, deploying 6G hotspot and emergency Qi5 wireless charging.&rdquo; The drone plants itself on my window and power returns to my apartment. My devices power up and simultaneously shriek at me to authenticate myself. &ldquo;Go AWAY!&rdquo; I yell at the drone. No response. It probably cannot hear me over all the noise in my apartment.</p>
                        
                        <p>Are you serious? Just let me sleep in peace. I cannot take this anymore. I open my window, reach outside, and grab one of the drone&rsquo;s docked legs and yank as hard as I can. The drone comes free from my window, and I drag it to the center of my small studio apartment. I then start assaulting the drone. Fists are flying, I pull all its landing gear off, I start to curb stomp the stupid drone. The noise of notifications still echoes throughout my room. This drone is tough.</p>
                        
                        <p>I walk to the corner of my room, grab my Alfonso Soriano signed Cubs baseball bat and start hitting the drone with all my strength. Soriano would approve. He wouldn&rsquo;t put up with this BS either.</p>
                        
                        <p>My apartment finally fell silent after a strong low swing to the center of the drone&rsquo;s body. Tranquility finally. I let out a sigh of relief and head over to my bed. I feel like garbage. My body is screaming at me to just lay down. I fall face first into my bed. My eyes instantly shut; I feel like I am about to shut down. Right before I slip out of consciousness, I hear outside my window a distant buzzing and an electronic voice reading out, &ldquo;Internet and power outage detected&#8230;&rdquo;</p>
