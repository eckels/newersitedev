                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This is a 2 semester project done with Hack4Impact aimed at extending the reach and efficiency for nonprofit <a href="https://www.lifeafterhate.org" target="_blank">Life After Hate</a> (LAH). <a href="https://uiuc.hack4impact.org" target="_blank">Hack4Impact</a> is an UIUC campus organization of students passionate about using tech for good. We develop products for nonprofits to help them further their mission and better engage their clients.</p>
                <p>They accomplish this goal this by connecting former hate group members or members trying to leave hate groups (called formers) to resources and partners within the LAH network.</p>
                <p>These partner businesses/individuals have volunteered their services and time to help those who are exiting hate groups. The LAH staff will then put the former in contact with these partner services to help them leave violence and racism behind. Some examples of resources are tattoo removal, career preparation, and education. ExitUSA is the specific branch of LAH that executes this process.</p>
                <blockquote><i>"Each year, more than 250,000 people in the United States are victims of hate crimes. The vast majority are violent and more than half go unreported. Between 2008 and 2017, 71 percent of extremist-related fatalities in the U.S. were committed by members of the far right or white-supremacist movements. LAH helps people leave the violent far-right to connect with humanity and lead compassionate lives."</i> - Life After Hate</blockquote>
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="img/lah-logo.png" alt="Life After Hate logo" style="width: 350px;" />
                </div>

                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>When helping people leave hate groups, LAH staff members need to sift through their resources located on many different platforms: Excel, email, paper, and more. These resources can be either businesses or organizations that will support ex-hate group members willing to change.</p>
                <p>This time sunk looking for resources is time not spent helping people exit hate groups, limiting LAH's reach as an organization. This bottleneck in the support process can also take up to days to complete. By automating and organizing the search process, we can speed up the process of matching resources to formers. We wanted to create a highly-secure, easily searchable, centralized web application to host and manage these resources. This way, we can enable LAH to spend more time serving people and accomplish their mission on a larger scale.</p>
                <h5>How LAH fits Hack4Impact's goals</h5>
                <p>When we heard about LAH's problems, we saw an immediate opportunity to help. Our organization aims to help nonprofits broaden their impact, and we do that by creating the necessary tools so that they can better focus on their core mission. When building a product, we put an emphasis on scalability, user-friendliness, and intentionality. We put special thought into building a product that can scale with the organization and support more staff along with the organization's future goals. Through rigorous user research and testing, we optimize the UX of our applications by building around the user. To make the product as impactful as possible, we personalized it to the use cases of the nonprofit. We consider the nonprofit the priority and end user, meaning that our products are made with their goals, staff, and audience in mind.</p>

                </div>

                <h5>Overview of solution</h5>
                <p>After a few calls with LAH, we found that a map view would be necessary for the platform since location and proximity of resources are important when LAH helps individuals. The map view would serve a similar purpose as websites such as Redfin, giving a visual representation of data to help illustrate distance and positioning. We are not as focused on the landscape as Redfin is when choosing real estate, but this map view is still necessary since proximity is important for our product. There is also the chance that the user may want to do a high-intent search, meaning they are looking for something very specific such as a particular resources contact name. In this case we need to display search results in a way that allows you to quickly skim through resource details. We did this by adding a separate directory view. This directory view focuses on displaying the details of the resources in a spreadsheet format to make it easy to quickly find the intended resource.</p>

                <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>I served as the Product Designer on a team with a Product Manager, Tech Lead and 5 developers. We had two different teams for the Fall and Spring semesters, only difference in composition being that the Spring team had one less developer.</p>
                <h5>Fall 2019 Team</h5>
                <img src="img/lah-fall.png" alt="Fall 2019 Team" />
                <h5>Spring 2020 Team</h5>
                <img src="img/lah-spring.png" alt="Spring 2020 Team" />
                <p>As a designer and Front-end Developer, I was in charge of the UI and UX of the application. I worked closely with the Product Manager to help create user-centric prototypes and mockups, while also working with Front-end Developers to implement these designs in React.js.</p>

                <h3>Product Scoping</h3>
                <p>The first things we had to address before we got building were the scope of the project and the constraints. We needed to ensure we were picking the most impactful features to include in our product while also considering the complexity that these features may bring to the project. By thoughtfully scoping this project out, we ensure we build a product that most effectively addresses LAH's problems in 2 semesters of development.</p>

                <h5>Scope</h5>
                <p>I gave a brief overview of the rationale behind the choice of having the map view along with the directory view. This gives a broad solution to LAH's problems, but there are many details that still need to be explored.</p>
                <p>In terms of users, we currently only have 1-2 of LAH's staff that would be using this product daily. While the current user base is small, LAH has plans to expand this resource/partner database to hundreds of volunteers and to grow their volunteer team in the future. To accommodate this, an account management system becomes a necessary feature.</p>
                <p>One feature we actually passed on was the optimization of the map view for mobile. Given our users, we found that the application would be used almost exclusively on desktop. The time we would spend making the map view on mobile would be better spent working on another feature, so we decided to pass on scoping a complex feature that would see little to no use.</p>
                <p>Since Hack4Impact works in increments of 1-2 semesters, it is important that we weight the complexity and impact of features against each other when deciding to include them or not. We have to prioritize completion of more important features to ensure we create the optimal product in our defined time frame.</p>

                <h5>Constraints</h5>
                <p>One constraint that was immediately obvious to us as an organization was the handoff from one team to another between the Fall and Spring semesters. We needed to ensure the second team could easily understand and work off of the existing codebase. We would need to pay special attention to naming conventions, code formatting, and standardizing the site structure.</p>
                <p>The way the project would pan out is that the Fall team would focus on the map and directory view while the Spring team would focus on account management and tying up loose ends. We focused on addressing the main map and directory views first so that we had time to process user testing and feedback to improve our principal features.</p>
                <p>Another constraint we came across concerned the security of our application. The data that we are displaying on our application has personally identifying information for the individuals and businesses volunteering their services. If a hate group were to get their hands on this information, it could be catastrophic for those businesses and individuals. To ensure the security of this information, we opted to use Google OAuth to handle sign-ins. Google is a widely used and highly secure service, so it was an optimal choice to ensure security and inclusivity for those who will access the platform.</p>
